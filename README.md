# Applications-of-DFA
This is a simple program that showcases how a DFA can become a program. 
This program is simple sprite animation that changes the action based on user input, allowing transitions between different movements and actions. 
When the user presses the left or right arrow keys, the sprite performs a running action, while pressing the up arrow key triggers a jump action. 
This creates an engaging experience where the sprite responds dynamically to player controls
